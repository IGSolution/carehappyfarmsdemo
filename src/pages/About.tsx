            <p className="text-lg mb-4">
              In 2011 we started growing and selling vegetables inspired by the
              opportunity of available arable land in Jos, Nigeria and the need
              to contribute to the nationsâ€™ March towards self-reliance in food
              production. The pictures in this document are original to us
              reflecting our effort since 2011.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg mb-4">
              Founded in 2024, we set out to bridge this gap using technology.
              Our platform eliminates middlemen, allowing farmers to showcase
              their products directly to customers across Nigeria's major
              cities.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              To meet the increasing demand for Nigerian grown fruits and
              vegetables, we have gone into partnerships with other local
              farmers. We have received training and guidance by the
              Agricultural Services Training Centre and provided income and
              employment to 10 young individuals.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              Since 2012 KRP Farms has serviced over 700 loyal individual and
              corporate clients across Nigeria. The group is constantly
              exploring opportunities for partnerships that add value to the
              supply chain and promote growth.
